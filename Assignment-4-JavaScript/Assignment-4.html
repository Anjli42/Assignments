    <h3>1. What is JavaScript?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming
                language.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Event Based Programming Language.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>2. What is the use of isNaN function?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>isNaN() method returns true if a value is Not-a-Number.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Number.isNaN() returns true if a number is Not-a-Number.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>isNaN() converts the value to a number before testing it.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>3. What is negative Infinity?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>4. Which company developed JavaScript?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications Corporation (now Mozilla
                Foundation) in 1995.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>5. What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Undeclared variables are those that have not been declared or defined in the current scope, while
                undefined variables are those that have been declared but not given a value.</p>
        </li>
        OR
        <li>
            <p>undeclared
                A variable is undeclared if it has not been declared with an appropriate keyword (i.e. var, let or
                const). Accessing an undeclared variable will throw a ReferenceError. <br><br>

              Ex: console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>undefined
                A variable is undefined if it hasn't been assigned a value. undefined is a primitive data type in
                JavaScript and represents the absence of a value, intentional or otherwise. <br><br>

                Ex: let x; <br>
                console.log(x); // undefined</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
